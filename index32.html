        <p><strong>How to Eat It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes to your meals. Opt for high-fiber options like oats, berries, broccoli, carrots, and lentils.</li>

        <h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Ginger and Peppermint üçÉ</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Ginger and peppermint are both known for their stomach-soothing properties. Ginger helps reduce nausea and inflammation, while peppermint relaxes the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, relieving bloating and cramps."</p>
