        <h1>Banish Bloating! 😌 5 Simple Tricks for a Happy Stomach</h1>
        <p class="introduction">
            "Bloating can make you feel sluggish, uncomfortable, and even self-conscious. But don’t worry—it’s a common issue and can often be managed with just a few simple changes. Let me guide you through five effective tricks to help you feel lighter and more comfortable."
        </p>

        <!-- Point 1 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>1️ Sip Warm Lemon Water 🍋</h2>
            <p>
                "Starting your day with warm lemon water can work wonders for your digestion. Lemon stimulates bile production, helping your stomach break down food more efficiently. The warm water soothes your digestive system, reducing the chances of gas and bloating."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Doctor’s Tip:</strong> "Drink this first thing in the morning on an empty stomach for the best results. You can also add a pinch of ginger or honey for added digestive benefits."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 2 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>2️ Eat Slowly and Chew Thoroughly 🥄</h2>
            <p>
                "Did you know that eating too quickly can trap air in your digestive system, causing bloating? Chewing your food thoroughly helps your stomach process it more easily, reducing gas and discomfort."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Practical Advice:</strong> "Take smaller bites, put your fork down between bites, and avoid talking while chewing. This not only reduces bloating but also helps you enjoy your meals more."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 3 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>3️ Avoid Carbonated Drinks 🥤</h2>
            <p>
                "Carbonated drinks, like soda and sparkling water, introduce excess gas into your stomach, leading to bloating. Replacing these with still water or herbal teas can make a big difference."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Doctor’s Reminder:</strong> "If you crave flavor, infuse your water with fresh fruits like strawberries or cucumber—it’s refreshing and gentle on your stomach."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 4 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>4️ Try a Gentle Tummy Massage 🤲</h2>
            <p>
                "A light abdominal massage can help move trapped gas through your digestive system. Use your fingertips to make circular motions around your belly button, applying gentle pressure."
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> "Start on your right side, move upward toward your ribs, across to the left side, and down again. This follows the natural path of your colon and helps relieve bloating."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 5 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>5️ Incorporate Probiotics into Your Diet 🥛</h2>
            <p>
                "Probiotics are good bacteria that support a healthy gut. They can improve digestion and reduce bloating caused by an imbalance in your gut flora. Foods like yogurt, kefir, and fermented vegetables are great sources."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> "If you’re not a fan of fermented foods, consider a high-quality probiotic supplement. Just make sure to choose one that suits your needs."

        <div class="point">
            <h2>Bonus Tip: Stay Active! 🏃‍♀️</h2>
            <p>
                "Light physical activity, like a short walk or yoga, can help your digestive system move smoothly, reducing bloating. Avoid lying down immediately after meals, as it can slow digestion."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Quick Suggestion:</strong> "Try yoga poses like ‘Child’s Pose’ or ‘Cat-Cow Stretch’ to release trapped gas and ease discomfort."
