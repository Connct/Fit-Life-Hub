        <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Gentle Stretches and Neck Exercises üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Gentle stretching helps relax the muscles in the neck, improving blood circulation and reducing stiffness. Neck exercises can strengthen the muscles and prevent further injury."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Neck Tilts: Sit or stand with your back straight. Slowly tilt your head toward your shoulder and hold for 15-20 seconds. Repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Neck Rotation: Turn your head to one side as far as you comfortably can and hold for 15 seconds. Repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>Chin Tucks: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest and hold for 5-10 seconds. Repeat 5-10 times to improve posture and ease tension.</li>

        <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Heat or Cold Compress üßäüî•</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Heat helps to relax tense muscles and improve circulation, while cold therapy numbs the area and reduces inflammation. Both can provide significant relief depending on the nature of the pain."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>For Cold Therapy: Wrap ice in a cloth or use a cold pack and apply it to the affected area for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>For Heat Therapy: Use a heating pad, warm towel, or hot water bottle to soothe sore muscles. Apply it for 15-20 minutes for effective relief.</li>
            <li>Switch between heat and cold depending on how your neck feels and the severity of the pain.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Massage can relieve muscle tension, improve blood flow, and reduce stress. Essential oils like lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus have calming and anti-inflammatory properties that can further ease pain."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mix a few drops of your preferred essential oil (peppermint, lavender, or eucalyptus) with a carrier oil, such as coconut or olive oil.</li>
            <li>Gently massage the oil into your neck and shoulders, focusing on the areas of tension.</li>

        <h2>6Ô∏è‚É£ Rest and Relaxation üí§</h2>

        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
