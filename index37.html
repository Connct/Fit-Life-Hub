        <h1>5-Minute Morning Routine for Glowing Skin ✨</h1>
        <p class="introduction">
            A glowing complexion doesn't always require a long and complicated skincare routine. In fact, a simple, 5-minute morning skincare routine can do wonders for your skin if you stay consistent! ✨ Let me walk you through the steps that will not only boost your glow but will also protect and hydrate your skin throughout the day.

        <h2>Step 1: Cleanse (1 Minute)</h2>
        <p><strong>The first step in any skincare routine is cleansing.</strong> Washing your face helps remove dirt, oil, and any product residue from the night before. You don't need a heavy-duty cleanser in the morning – just something gentle to get your skin ready for the next steps. 🌸</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose a mild, hydrating cleanser that won't strip your skin of its natural oils. Look for ones that contain ingredients like glycerin or aloe vera for added moisture!</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Step 2: Tone (1 Minute)</h2>
        <p><strong>Toning is an often-overlooked step</strong> but it’s essential for balancing your skin’s pH levels after cleansing. A toner can also help tighten pores and prepare your skin to absorb the next products better. Choose a toner that matches your skin type—hydrating for dry skin or mattifying for oily skin.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid toners with alcohol, as they can dry out your skin. Go for natural ingredients like rose water or witch hazel! 🌿</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Step 3: Moisturize (1 Minute)</h2>
        <p><strong>Even if you have oily skin, moisturizing is a must!</strong> Moisturizers lock in hydration and help maintain your skin’s elasticity. Pick a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer to keep your skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you're in a rush, look for a moisturizer with built-in SPF to save time and protect your skin from UV rays. ☀️</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Step 4: Sunscreen (2 Minutes)</h2>
        <p><strong>Never skip sunscreen!</strong> The sun’s UV rays can damage your skin even when it’s cloudy, leading to premature aging, wrinkles, and dark spots. Applying sunscreen will protect your skin and enhance your glow.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30. Apply it generously to your face and neck, and don’t forget areas like your ears and under your chin. 🧴</p>
