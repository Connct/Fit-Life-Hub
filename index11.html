        <h1>Neck Pain Relief in Minutes 💆‍♀️ Easy Exercises for Instant Comfort</h1>
        <p class="introduction">
            "Neck pain is a common issue, and most of the time, it’s caused by poor posture, stress, or spending too much time looking down at phones or screens. The good news is that you don’t have to suffer for long! I’ll walk you through some quick and simple exercises that you can do anywhere to ease your neck pain almost instantly."
        </p>

        <!-- Point 1 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>1️ Neck Stretch (Side to Side) 🧘‍♀️</h2>
            <p>
                "Let’s start with a basic neck stretch. Sit up straight in a chair or stand tall. Now, gently tilt your head to the right, bringing your ear toward your shoulder. You’ll feel a nice stretch on the left side of your neck. Hold this position for 10-15 seconds, then slowly return to the center and repeat on the other side."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctor’s Tip:</strong> "Don’t force your head down too much. It’s a gentle stretch, so go only as far as feels comfortable."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 2 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>2️ Neck Rotations (Look Left, Look Right) 👀</h2>
            <p>
                "This one is super easy and effective. Turn your head slowly to the left as if you’re looking over your shoulder. Hold for 10 seconds, then slowly turn to the right. This movement helps loosen stiff neck muscles and improves mobility."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Advice:</strong> "Do this 5-6 times on each side. If you feel a slight crack or pop, don’t worry—it’s just your joints releasing tension."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 3 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>3️ Forward and Backward Tilt 🙇‍♀️</h2>
            <p>
                "Now let’s work on the front and back muscles. Tilt your head forward, bringing your chin toward your chest, and hold for 10 seconds. Then tilt your head back slowly, looking up at the ceiling. This stretch is great for relieving tension caused by poor posture."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Warning:</strong> "If tilting backward causes dizziness or discomfort, stop immediately and focus on the forward stretch."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 4 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>4️ Shoulder Shrugs 🤷‍♂️</h2>
            <p>
                "Your neck pain might actually stem from tension in your shoulders. To release that tension, lift your shoulders up toward your ears as if you’re shrugging. Hold for a few seconds, then drop them back down. Repeat this 10 times."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Helpful Tip:</strong> "Do this exercise throughout the day, especially if you sit at a desk for long hours."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 5 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>5️ Chin Tucks 🦢</h2>
            <p>
                "Chin tucks are excellent for correcting forward head posture. Sit or stand with your back straight. Gently pull your chin back, as if you’re trying to make a double chin. Hold for 5 seconds, then release. This strengthens the muscles at the back of your neck and improves alignment."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctor’s Note:</strong> "Start with 5 repetitions and gradually increase to 10 as your muscles strengthen."

            <h2>Bonus: Massage for Instant Relief 💆‍♀️</h2>
            <p>
                "Along with these exercises, try gently massaging the base of your neck and shoulders with your fingertips. Use circular motions to release knots and improve blood circulation. You can also use a warm compress afterward for even better results."
