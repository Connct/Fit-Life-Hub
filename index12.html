        <p class="introduction">
            "Feeling under the weather? Colds can leave you tired, congested, and downright miserable. But don’t worry—there are plenty of natural remedies that can help you recover faster. Let’s focus on five simple but effective home remedies to soothe your symptoms and boost your immune system."
        </p>

        <div class="point">
            <h2>1️⃣ Stay Hydrated with Warm Fluids 🍵</h2>
            <p>
                "The first thing to do is stay hydrated. Warm fluids, like herbal teas, broths, or even plain warm water, can help soothe a sore throat and keep your nasal passages moist. Ginger tea is especially good because it has anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce congestion and provide comfort."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctor’s Advice:</strong> "Drink at least 8-10 cups of warm liquids throughout the day. Adding a bit of honey to your tea can also help calm a cough."
            </p>

        <div class="point">
            <h2>2️⃣ Steam Inhalation 🌫️</h2>
            <p>
                "Steam inhalation is excellent for clearing a blocked nose and reducing sinus pressure. Just boil some water, pour it into a bowl, and lean over it with a towel draped over your head. Inhale the steam deeply for about 5-10 minutes."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> "Add a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil to the water for a stronger decongestant effect."

        <!-- Point 3 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>3️⃣ Gargle with Salt Water 🪠</h2>
            <p>
                "If you’re dealing with a sore throat, a saltwater gargle can work wonders. Mix half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and gargle for 30 seconds. This helps reduce swelling and kill bacteria in the throat."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctor’s Note:</strong> "Repeat this 3-4 times a day. It’s an old remedy, but it’s one of the most effective!"
