        <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Hydrate ‚Äì Drink Water! üíß</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Dehydration is a common cause of headaches. Drinking water helps to rehydrate the body, relieve tension, and improve circulation to your brain. Just a few sips can work wonders for relieving headache symptoms."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by sipping small amounts of water throughout the day. Aim for at least 8 cups daily.</li>
            <li>If you‚Äôre already feeling a headache, drink a glass of water slowly and see how it affects the pain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Apply a Cold or Warm Compress üßäüî•</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "A cold compress can help reduce inflammation and numb the area, which can relieve tension headaches. A warm compress, on the other hand, works best for soothing muscle tightness in the neck and shoulders, which often causes headaches."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>For a cold compress, wrap a few ice cubes in a cloth and apply to your forehead for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>For a warm compress, use a heating pad or warm towel and place it around your neck or over your forehead.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Try Aromatherapy with Essential Oils üå∏</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Essential oils like peppermint, lavender, and eucalyptus have been shown to reduce headache pain and stress. The soothing scent can help calm the mind and relieve tension. Peppermint oil, for example, increases blood flow and can relax tight muscles around the head and neck."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a few drops of peppermint or lavender oil to a diffuser or apply them to your temples and the back of your neck.</li>
            <li>You can also add a drop or two to a cotton ball and inhale deeply.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4Ô∏è‚É£ Perform a Quick Acupressure Technique üñêÔ∏è</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Acupressure is an ancient technique that applies pressure to specific points on the body. It helps balance energy and relax muscles, reducing pain. The 'webbed' area between your thumb and index finger is known to be a key pressure point for headache relief."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find the area between your thumb and index finger.</li>
            <li>Apply gentle but firm pressure for about 5 minutes while taking slow, deep breaths.</li>
            <li>Focus on relaxing your body as you apply pressure, allowing the pain to diminish.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5Ô∏è‚É£ Massage Your Temples and Neck üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Tension headaches often originate from tight muscles in the neck and scalp. A quick self-massage can relieve tightness, improve circulation, and ease headache symptoms."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use your fingers to gently massage your temples in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>Apply light pressure and gradually move down to your neck, massaging the muscles there.</li>
            <li>If possible, try massaging your shoulders as well to release built-up tension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6Ô∏è‚É£ Close Your Eyes and Rest üí§</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Sometimes the best way to relieve a headache is to simply close your eyes and give your body time to rest. Light sensitivity often accompanies headaches, so removing visual stimuli can make a big difference. This also allows your mind to relax, helping to ease stress-induced headaches."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a quiet, dark place where you can sit or lie down comfortably.</li>
            <li>Close your eyes and breathe deeply for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Avoid distractions and focus on calming your mind.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7Ô∏è‚É£ Drink Herbal Tea üçµ</h2>
        <p><strong>Why It Works:</strong> "Herbal teas like ginger, chamomile, or peppermint are known for their soothing properties. Ginger can reduce inflammation, while chamomile is excellent for calming the mind. Drinking a warm, relaxing tea helps hydrate your body and provides comfort during a headache episode."</p>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brew a cup of your favorite herbal tea and sip it slowly.</li>
            <li>Add honey or lemon for extra soothing benefits.</li>
            <li>Consider drinking ginger tea if your headache is accompanied by nausea.</li>
