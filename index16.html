        <h1>Struggling with Tension Headaches? 💆‍♂️ Here's What Works</h1>
        <p class="introduction">
            "Tension headaches are one of the most common types of headaches and can feel like a tight band wrapping around your head. They’re often triggered by stress, poor posture, or lack of sleep. Let’s explore some effective strategies to ease the pain and prevent them from coming back."
        </p>

        <!-- Point 1 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>1️ Practice Deep Breathing or Meditation 🧘‍♀️</h2>
            <p>
                "Stress is a major trigger for tension headaches. Deep breathing and meditation help relax your mind and body, reducing tension in your muscles."
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> "Find a quiet space, close your eyes, and take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try doing this for 5-10 minutes whenever you feel a headache coming on."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 2 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>2️ Apply a Warm or Cold Compress 🔥❄️</h2>
            <p>
                "Heat helps relax tight muscles, while cold reduces inflammation and numbs pain. Both can work well for tension headaches depending on your preference."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Doctor’s Advice:</strong> "Use a warm compress on your neck and shoulders if your headache is due to muscle tightness. If the pain is sharp or throbbing, try a cold pack on your forehead or temples."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 3 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>3️ Stretch and Adjust Your Posture 🧍‍♂️</h2>
            <p>
                "Poor posture, like hunching over a desk, can strain your neck and shoulders, leading to tension headaches. Gentle stretches and improving your posture can provide relief."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Quick Stretch Tip:</strong> "Try the chin tuck exercise: Pull your chin slightly backward as if making a double chin. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times. It helps relax neck muscles."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 4 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>4️ Stay Hydrated 💧</h2>
            <p>
                "Dehydration is another common cause of headaches. Even mild dehydration can lead to tension and discomfort."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> "Keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day. If you find plain water boring, add slices of lemon or cucumber for a refreshing twist."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 5 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>5️ Massage Your Temples and Neck 💆</h2>
            <p>
                "Gently massaging your temples, neck, and shoulders can help relieve muscle tension and improve blood flow, easing the headache."
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> "Use your fingers to apply light pressure in circular motions for 2-3 minutes. Focus on areas where you feel tightness or pain."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 6 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>6️ Manage Stress with Regular Breaks 🖥️➡️🚶‍♀️</h2>
            <p>
                "Sitting for long periods, especially in front of a screen, can trigger tension headaches. Regular breaks can help reduce strain on your eyes and muscles."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Doctor’s Tip:</strong> "Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Stretch your neck and shoulders during these breaks too."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 7 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>7️ Try Over-the-Counter Pain Relief (If Needed) 💊</h2>
            <p>
                "If the headache persists, an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help. But don’t rely on them too often, as they can cause rebound headaches if overused."
            </p>
            <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> "If you find yourself taking painkillers frequently, it’s a good idea to consult a doctor to find a more sustainable solution."
