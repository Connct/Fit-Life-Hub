        <h1>Feeling Queasy? 🤢 7 Stomach Ache Solutions at Home!</h1>
        <p class="introduction">
            "Stomach aches can be incredibly uncomfortable, can’t they? Whether it’s due to overeating, indigestion, or something you can’t quite figure out, I’ve got you covered. Let’s go over seven effective home remedies that can help soothe your stomach and get you feeling better in no time."
        </p>

        <!-- Point 1 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>1️ Sip on Ginger Tea 🍵</h2>
            <p>
                "Ginger is one of the best natural remedies for stomach pain and nausea. It works by reducing inflammation and improving digestion. All you need to do is grate some fresh ginger, boil it in water for 5-10 minutes, and sip it slowly. It’s particularly helpful if your stomach ache is due to bloating or gas."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctor’s Note:</strong> "If fresh ginger isn’t available, you can use ginger powder or even chew on a small piece of candied ginger."
            </p>

        <!-- Point 2 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>2️ Use a Warm Compress 🔥</h2>
            <p>
                "Sometimes, stomach pain is caused by muscle cramps or indigestion. Applying a warm compress or heating pad to your abdomen can help relax the muscles and improve blood circulation, easing the pain."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Practical Tip:</strong> "Make sure the compress isn’t too hot. Wrap it in a towel before placing it on your stomach, and leave it there for 15-20 minutes."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 3 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>3️ Drink Mint Tea 🌿</h2>
            <p>
                "Mint, especially peppermint, can work wonders for an upset stomach. It has antispasmodic properties that help relax the muscles in your digestive tract. Brew some fresh mint leaves in hot water, let it steep for 5 minutes, and drink it slowly."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Helpful Tip:</strong> "Avoid mint if you have acid reflux—it can sometimes make it worse."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 4 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>4️ Try the BRAT Diet 🍌</h2>
            <p>
                "When your stomach is sensitive, stick to the BRAT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods are easy to digest, help firm up loose stools, and don’t irritate your stomach."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctor’s Advice:</strong> "Eat small portions and chew your food well. This diet is especially helpful if your stomach ache is accompanied by diarrhea."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 5 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>5️ Stay Hydrated 💧</h2>
            <p>
                "Dehydration can make a stomach ache worse, especially if you’ve been vomiting or have diarrhea. Sip on clear fluids like water, coconut water, or clear broths throughout the day. Avoid caffeinated or sugary drinks, as they can irritate your stomach."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> "Take small sips instead of gulping to prevent triggering nausea."

        <div class="point">
            <h2>6️ Baking Soda and Water 🥄</h2>
            <p>
                "Feeling bloated or gassy? A teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a glass of water can help neutralize stomach acid and relieve indigestion. Drink this slowly for quick relief."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Warning:</strong> "Don’t use this remedy too often, as excess baking soda can cause side effects."
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Point 7 -->
        <div class="point">
            <h2>7️ Rest in a Comfortable Position 🛌</h2>
            <p>
                "Sometimes, all your stomach needs is a little rest. Lie down on your side or back with a pillow under your knees to reduce pressure on your abdomen. If you’re feeling bloated, lying on your left side can help gas pass more easily."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Doctor’s Reminder:</strong> "Take deep breaths and avoid curling up too tightly, as that can worsen cramps."
