        <h2>Why Deep Breathing Works for Headache Relief</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduces Stress and Tension:</strong> Stress and muscle tension are common headache triggers. Deep breathing activates the body‚Äôs relaxation response, reducing stress levels and muscle tightness, especially in the neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Oxygen Flow to the Brain:</strong> Deep breathing increases the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream, which helps nourish the brain and relieve discomfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes Calmness and Focus:</strong> By focusing on your breath, you can redirect your mind from the pain and create a sense of calm, which is essential for alleviating headache symptoms.</li>
